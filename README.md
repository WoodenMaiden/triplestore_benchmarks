# Triplestore benchmark

This repo aims to compare many RDFS triplestores by their performance on a given dataset.

Tested databases are: 
- [Openlink Virtuoso 7 OSS](https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource)
- [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/fr/) using neosemantic's [RDF plugin](https://neo4j.com/labs/neosemantics/)
- [GraphDB](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/)
- [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/)

The test are running with the [Muninn World War I](https://old.datahub.io/dataset/muninn-world-war-i) dataset.
